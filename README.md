## General Information
- This project aims to analyze factors affecting bike-sharing demand and build a model to predict future demand, helping the company better plan for resource allocation.
- **Background**: Bike-sharing systems are becoming increasingly popular, allowing individuals to rent bikes for short-term use. Understanding the demand trends helps companies manage inventory and provide a better user experience.
- **Business Problem**: BoomBikes, a U.S.-based bike-sharing provider, wants to predict demand for bikes post-pandemic. This insight will help them tailor their business strategy and maximize profits.
- **Dataset Used**: The dataset includes daily bike demand with features like weather conditions, seasonal effects, holidays, and working days, along with the actual daily demand (`cnt`).

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Year (`yr`) and Season (`season`) have a significant impact on bike demand, with higher demand in 2019 and during summer and fall.
- High temperatures positively correlate with bike demand, while high humidity and windspeed negatively impact it.
